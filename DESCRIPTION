Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.2.9000
Date: 2020-1-7
Description: Robust estimation methods for the mean vector and covariance matrix 
    from data (possibly containing NAs) under multivariate heavy-tailed 
    distributions such as angular Gaussian (via Tyler's method), Cauchy, 
    and Student's t. 
    Additionally, a factor model structure can be specified for the covariance 
    matrix.
    The package is based on the papers: Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2014),
    Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2015), Liu and Rubin (1995), and 
    Zhou, Liu, Kumar, and Palomar (2019).
