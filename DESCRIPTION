Title: Mean and Covariance Matrix Estimation under Heavy Tails
Version: 0.1.4.9000
Date: 2023-5-11
Description: Robust estimation methods for the mean vector, scatter matrix,
    and covariance matrix (if it exists) from data (possibly containing NAs) 
    under multivariate heavy-tailed distributions such as angular Gaussian 
    (via Tyler's method), Cauchy, and Student's t distributions. Additionally, 
    a factor model structure can be specified for the covariance matrix. The
    latest revision also includes the multivariate skewed t distribution.
    The package is based on the papers: Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2014);
    Sun, Babu, and Palomar (2015); Liu and Rubin (1995);
    Zhou, Liu, Kumar, and Palomar (2019); Pascal, Ollila, and Palomar (2021).
